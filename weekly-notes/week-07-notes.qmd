## Key Concepts Learned
- Focused on **cross-validation** for spatial models.  
- Reviewed problems caused by **sparse categories** in CV splits.  
- Learned how to **group small neighborhoods** to avoid errors.  
- Compared models: structural, +spatial, and +fixed effects.  
- Discussed **RMSE** as a key metric for prediction accuracy.  

## Coding Techniques
- Used `caret::train()` for **10-fold CV**.  
- Created grouped neighborhood factors (`name_cv`) with `mutate()` and `add_count()`.  
- Compared RMSE across models to evaluate improvements.  
- Practiced model selection workflow from simple → complex.  

## Questions & Challenges
- How to choose the right number of folds for spatial CV?  
- When to drop vs. group rare neighborhood categories?  
- How to interpret RMSE magnitude in housing price models?  

## Connections to Policy
- Reliable validation ensures **fairer property assessments**.  
- Model transparency supports **public trust** in tax estimation.  
- Highlights the importance of **data sufficiency** in small-area analysis.  

## Reflection
- Learned that validation is as important as model fitting.  
- Grouping sparse data prevents misleading model results.  
- Cross-validation helps test generalizability of spatial models.
