## Key Concepts Learned
- Introduced **logistic regression** for predicting binary outcomes (0/1).  
- Explained why linear regression fails for probabilities (>1 or <0).  
- Learned the **logit transformation** (log-odds) and **odds ratios** interpretation.  
- Discussed model evaluation using **confusion matrices**, **ROC curves**, and **AUC**.  
- Highlighted **threshold selection** and trade-offs between sensitivity and specificity.  
- Connected model performance with **ethical and equity concerns** in prediction.  

## Coding Techniques
- Used `glm(..., family = "binomial")` to fit logistic regression models.  
- Converted coefficients to **odds ratios** with `exp(coef(model))`.  
- Calculated metrics using `confusionMatrix()` from **caret**.  
- Created **ROC curves** with `pROC::roc()` and visualized AUC values.  
- Tested multiple probability thresholds to evaluate trade-offs.  

## Questions & Challenges
- How to set the “right” threshold when costs of errors differ?  
- What happens when class imbalance skews precision and recall?  
- How to interpret log-odds coefficients meaningfully for policy?  
- Can a model be “accurate” yet still inequitable across groups?  

## Connections to Policy
- Logistic regression supports **risk-based decision-making** in justice, health, and housing.  
- Helps policymakers weigh trade-offs between **false positives and false negatives**.  
- Raises awareness of **algorithmic fairness**—equal accuracy doesn’t mean equal treatment.  
- Informs **transparent and accountable** threshold setting for predictive systems.  

## Reflection
- Learned to see logistic regression as a **probabilistic decision tool**, not just a model.  
- Understood the power and risk of threshold choices in real-world applications.  
- ROC and AUC visualizations clarified the balance between sensitivity and precision.  
- Important takeaway: **Statistical accuracy must be paired with ethical awareness**.
