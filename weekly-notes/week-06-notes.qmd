## Key Concepts Learned
- Reviewed the **limitations of simple linear models** that ignore spatial context.  
- Introduced **categorical variables**, **interaction terms**, and **polynomial terms** to capture complex relationships.  
- Learned how to convert data to **spatial features (sf)** and join with neighborhood boundaries.  
- Built spatial features: **buffer aggregation**, **k-nearest neighbors (kNN)**, and **distance to amenities**.  
- Added **fixed effects** to control for unobserved neighborhood characteristics.  
- Practiced **cross-validation (CV)** for model comparison and predictive accuracy.  

## Coding Techniques
- Used `st_as_sf()` and `st_join()` to make spatial data and link to neighborhoods.  
- Created dummy variables automatically in R with `as.factor()`.  
- Implemented **interaction models** using `*` to test slope differences.  
- Built polynomial regressions with `I(Age^2)` to capture non-linear effects.  
- Generated spatial features (`st_buffer`, `st_distance`) and crime proximity variables.  
- Applied `caret::train()` for **10-fold cross-validation** and RMSE evaluation.  

## Questions & Challenges
- How to interpret interaction coefficients when both intercept and slope change?  
- When to prefer polynomial terms over log transformations?  
- How to handle **sparse categorical data** during CV without overfitting?  
- What is the best practice for balancing model complexity and interpretability?  

## Connections to Policy
- Spatial features and fixed effects improve **housing valuation fairness** across neighborhoods.  
- Interaction and non-linear terms reveal **market segmentation** and inequality.  
- Supports **policy design** by quantifying how location and neighborhood context shape value.  
- Helps urban agencies develop **context-sensitive property tax assessments**.  

## Reflection
- Learned how adding spatial and interaction terms can greatly improve model accuracy.  
- Realized that **location effects** often explain more variation than structure alone.
- Fixed effects capture local characteristics that are otherwise hard to measure.  
- Cross-validation provided a more reliable metric for comparing complex spatial models.
