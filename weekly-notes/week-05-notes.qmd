## Key Concepts Learned
- Reviewed **assumptions of linear regression**: linearity, independence, homoscedasticity, and normality.  
- Introduced **diagnostic tools** to assess model fit using residuals.  
- Learned to identify **multicollinearity** with Variance Inflation Factor (VIF).  
- Discussed **heteroskedasticity** and how it affects coefficient reliability.  
- Explored **spatial autocorrelation** using Moran’s I to detect clustered residuals.  

## Coding Techniques
- Used `lm()` to fit baseline regression models.  
- Checked heteroskedasticity with `bptest()` from the **lmtest** package.  
- Calculated **VIF** with `car::vif()` to detect multicollinearity.  
- Computed **Moran’s I** using the **spdep** package with spatial weights.  
- Visualized residuals using `ggplot2` to spot non-random spatial patterns.  

## Questions & Challenges
- How to decide when spatial autocorrelation is strong enough to justify a spatial model?  
- What threshold of VIF should trigger variable removal?  
- When residuals show heteroskedasticity, is log transformation or robust SE better?  
- How to distinguish random outliers from systematic spatial effects?  

## Connections to Policy
- Diagnostic analysis ensures **fair and consistent property value models**.  
- Detecting spatial bias prevents over- or under-assessment in certain neighborhoods.  
- Supports **data-driven urban policy** by verifying that spatial effects are accounted for.  

## Reflection
- Learned to see diagnostics as essential for **trustworthy regression models**.  
- Realized that ignoring residual structure can lead to misleading results.  
- Moran’s I provided a bridge between statistics and spatial thinking.  
- Will apply these checks to refine the AVM model for Philadelphia housing data.
